# Contrubuting 
Welcome to the SAP1Emu Project! We are so glad that you want to help contribute to this Open Source Education Tool.

This guide will go over how to contribute, rules and some common setups so you can hit the ground running.
Before continuing, please also read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Good First Issues - A Good Place to Start

The SAP1Emu Project works off of Issue Tickets when deciding what to work on.  All plans are converted into Issue Tickets, of which there are three types:
* Bug Reports
* Feature Requests 
* Project Workflow Items

As these tickets are created or submitted by users, the Dev Team will label and triage the tickets. At any point, feel free to "take ownership" of a ticket by commenting on it or emailing me (rbaker26) regarding your interest in said ticket. Tickets labeled with **Good First Issue** are those which would be easier for a new-comer or are meant to familiarize the user with the code base. 

Don't see your desired issue? [Open](https://github.com/rbaker26/SAP1EMU/issues/new/choose) a Bug Report or Feature Request.


## Aw Fork
To start working on the project, you will need to fork it.  Once forked, create a new branch and give it a descriptive title (i.e. InputBugFix or CSS_Cleanup). After all that is done, start working on the ticket.  Make sure to add testing if required. When you are satisfied with the work done on the ticket, its time to submit a Pull Request.
