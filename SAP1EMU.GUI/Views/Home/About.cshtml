    <h2>About this Project</h2>
    <p>
        The SAP1Emu Project is an open-source suite of tools designed for students and educators teaching
        introductory courses in Computer Architecture or Digital Electronics.
        It emulates the SAP1 Computer from <i>Digital Computer Electronics by Malvino and Brown</i>. <br /> <br />

        This website provides an easy interface to the SAP1Emu API and Engine.
        A desktop app is in the works and the Engine CLI and Libary is also availble for download from the GitHub Repo.<br />
        The desktop version will launch shortly after .NET 5 launches (late 2020).

                My name is Bob Baker and I am a Software Engineer mostly focusing on C#/.NET Core and C++.

                <br />
                Before becoming a Profesional Developer, I worked at Saddleback College as a Teacher's Assistant for the Intro to Computer Architecture and Machine Language Lab (CS1C).
                As a TA I assisted many students in the building and debugging of SAP1 Computers.
                During this time I found that, while there are a few software solutions to assist students; most were "half-baked", were no longer supported, or did not follow
                the specification outlined by Malvino.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the middle of Spring 2020, Saddleback had to shutdown due to the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic and many students could not finish their final assignment for the course.
                To help with that challange, I started this project and it has grown since then.

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        The SAP1Emu Project is an open-source suite of tools designed for students and educators teaching introductory courses in Computer Architecture or Digital Electronics.
        It emulates the SAP1 computer from <i>Digital Computer Electronics by Malvino and Brown</i>.
        <br />
        This Project is designed to assist in the building and programing of a SAP1 Computer.
        Ben Eater has a great series of videos detailing building the SAP1 computer in a breadboard setup.
        This project compliments Ben Eater's videos by allowing the student access to step-by-step debugging of an emulated SAP1 Computer.
        <br />
        Students can compare the output of their SAP1 to the output of the SAP1Emu Emulator.
        This can be done on a step-by-step basis by setting breakpoints and single-stepping the Emulator through their program.
        <br />
        This Project is free and open-souce.
        <br />
        For more info, please see the license on the Project's Github page.

    <h4>Who am I?</h4>
    <p>
        My name is Bob Baker and, at the time of writing, I am a Computer Science Student at Saddleback College in Orange County, California.
        <br />
        The majority of my programming focus is on C++ and C# with an emphasis on ASP.NET Core.
        I have worked with other languages like Java, SQL, and Python, but mostly for academic projects. <br />

    <h4>Why this project?</h4>
    <p>
        At Saddleback College, I worked as a Teachers Assistant in the Intro to Computer Architecture and Machine Language Lab
        where I assisted students in the building and debugging of SAP1 Computers.
        I found that, while there are a few software solutions to assist students; most were "half-baked", were no longer supported, or did not follow
        the specification outlined by Malvino.
        <br />
        For these reasons, I decided to create the SAP1Emu Project.
